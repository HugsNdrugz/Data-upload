​​To address the "Validation Error: Could not identify table schema" issue in your data upload application, it's essential to ensure that the data cleaning logic aligns with the expected table schemas.​​ Here's a step-by-step approach to review and enhance the cleaning process:

1. Review the sanitize_dataframe Function: ​​The sanitize_dataframe function is responsible for cleaning the uploaded data.​​ ​​Ensure that this function:

Removes completely empty rows and columns.

Strips whitespace from string columns.

Replaces empty strings with NaN.

Removes special characters that might cause issues.

Converts columns to appropriate data types (e.g., datetime, numeric).​​


2. Verify Column Headers After Cleaning: ​​After the data is sanitized, the column headers should match the expected schema exactly.​​ ​​This includes:

Correct spelling and capitalization.

No leading or trailing whitespace.

Proper data types for each column.​​


3. Enhance Schema Detection Logic: ​​The function responsible for identifying the table schema should:

Compare the cleaned dataframe's columns with predefined schemas.

Perform case-insensitive comparisons.

Trim any leading or trailing whitespace from column names.

Allow for optional columns if they are not mandatory for the schema.​​


4. Implement Debugging Statements: ​​Add logging or print statements to:

Display the dataframe's columns after cleaning.

Show the expected schema for comparison.

Identify any discrepancies between the actual and expected columns.​​


5. Ensure Data Consistency: ​​Confirm that the uploaded file's data:

Aligns with the expected format.

Does not contain extraneous rows (e.g., metadata or empty rows) that could interfere with header detection.​​


6. Update the identify_table Function: ​​Modify the identify_table function to standardize headers for comparison and ensure all required headers are present.​​

Example: ​​```python def identify_table(df: pd.DataFrame) -> Optional[str]: """Identify the table schema based on dataframe headers.""" table_schemas = { "Contacts": {"name", "phone_number", "email", "last_contacted"}, "InstalledApps": {"application_name", "package_name", "install_date"}, "Calls": {"call_type", "time", "from_to", "duration", "location"}, "SMS": {"sms_type", "time", "from_to", "text", "location"}, "ChatMessages": {"sender", "time", "text"}, "Keylogs": {"application", "time", "text"}, }

# Standardize headers for comparison
file_headers = set(df.columns.str.lower().str.strip())
for table_name, schema_headers in table_schemas.items():
    if schema_headers.issubset(file_headers):  # Ensure all required headers are present
        return table_name

return None

**7. Test with Sample Data:**
​20​Use sample data files that match the expected schemas to test the application.​21​ ​22​This will help identify if the issue lies with the data cleaning process or the schema detection logic.​23​

By following these steps, you can ensure that the data cleaning logic correctly prepares the uploaded data for schema identification, thereby resolving the validation error.​24​
